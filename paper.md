#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa
Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004)
Jones et al (1998), conducted several studies in this region but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.


#Motivation
Find out more about this important phenomenon.

#Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region
